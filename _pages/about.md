Hi, I’m **İrem Aydaş**, a **PhD candidate in Political Science at Sabancı University**. 

My research interests include **political attitudes**, **voting behavior**, **political psychology**, **political methodology**, and **artificial intelligence**. I currently work as a **Teaching Assistant** for two research methods courses and help students learn **R programming**. You can explore my teaching materials at [iremaydas.com/teaching-r](https://www.iremaydas.com/teaching-r/).

I also created my **first interactive Quarto tutorial** at [iremaydas.com/tutorial](https://www.iremaydas.com/tutorial/). I enjoy building small projects that make coding and data analysis easier to understand.

Outside of academia, I’m a **PADI Advanced Open Water Diver**, a **thriller movie fan**, and someone who likes to “vibe code” for fun. I usually have too many ideas at once, so feel free to reach out. I always enjoy hearing from curious, creative people!
